description = """
Daemons with this trait have one specific value that describes their current position.
This position can be set (using the set_position method).
In general, these daemons may not be able to reach exactly the set position.
The destination (get_destination) returns exactly the set position, while the position (get_position) returns the current actual position of the daemon.
These daemons should start motion and become busy when set_daemon is called.
They should release busy once they arrive as close as possible to the destination, and their position should not change until set_position is called again.
