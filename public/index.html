<h1>yaq - yet another acquisition</h1>

a modular and extensible instrument control framework... <br>
with opinions

<hr>

<h2>separate, but friendly</h2>

<p>
In yaq, each remote device is addressed via a daemon.
yaq defines a commonunication standard on top of TCP which clients use to communicate with daemons.
By communicating over TCP, yaq allows each client and daemon to... <br>
- run in separate processes <br>
- be implemented in a different language <br>
- be versioned separately <br>
- communicate without locking <br>
</p>

<p>
This well-defined separtation between each daemon and client makes the yaq control framework less fragile than monolithic applications.
At the same time, the language-agnostic and separate distribution channels for each daemon make it trivial to use and reuse pieces from instrument to instrument, as needed.
The developer-friendly TCP communication standard makes it easy to write flexable clients for any application.
</p>

<h2>all in the family</h2>

<p>
yaq attempts to define a daemon family inheritence structure.
By enforcing this structure, yaq highlights the similarities been different daemon instances, making it easier to create more flexable and generic clients.
The family inheritence helps ensure that good conventions are known and applied well to each applicable daemon.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the yaq communication standard is totally generic.
yaq daemons are by no means required to have family members.
